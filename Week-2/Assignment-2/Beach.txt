December 2019
My boyfriend and I stayed at Tablas Point during Typhoon Ursula. We arrived a couple of days before and the room was lovely, really spacious and clean with a huge king size bed. We snorkelled and swam and sunbathed. Sadly the Typhoon destroyed much of the resort, but Kasha and her team led all the guests to safety while winds raged around us, and we were provided with accommodation for the night after all the buildings came down. I can't recommend Tablas Point enough for their hospitality and grace under pressure. Despite losing everything the day of the typhoon they remained cheerful, friendly and professional and even cooked a delicious Christmas dinner that evening! When the resort reopens, I highly recommend staying there.

This was the perfect getaway both for my wife and myself. Tablas Point is a gem in a beautiful island away from the hustle and bustle of Boracay and the rest of the hyper touristy spots.
Arriving here was a bit of a challenge, and we are truly seasoned travelers. Our advice is for you to arrive to Caticlan airport as early as you can, to ensure the local AM ferry, or fly directly to Tablas airport.
We stayed 5 nights, and we enjoyed every moment of it. We even rented a scooter to drive around the island. The beach is a bit rocky, but incredibly beautiful and the snorkeling is truly extraordinary.
We booked the king room, and the safari style tents were very stylish. Bed was comfortable. Mosquito nets and fans made a huge difference. Restrooms outside were not an issue, they are shared, but always impeccably clean.
We are very grateful for everyone at Tablas Point for an adventure of a lifetime!

Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and didn’t want to leave this little paradise! Food was great- Pork Belly, Pizzas, Pancit Bihon and clubhouse sandwich are a MUST try. Loved waking up to the sea. Room was great, bed super comfortable! Toilet and showers good. Welcoming and attentive hosts. 100% can recommend and 100% will be back... maybe even have our wedding here!!!! Thanks again Sharon & whole team :)

This was a perfect stay for us. After two weeks on Boracay, it was so nice to come to the peacefulness and beauty of Tablas Point. And the hosts are so welcoming and warm. This place is highly recommended if you are looking for a quiet and beautiful resort. They were also very helpful when we wanted to rent scooters to see the Island and they have a wide range of equipment, like paddleboards and snorkling equipment, available for free. The cottages are spacious and the view is marvellous. We loved our stay!

Mon´s English is not 100 % fluent, but usually there is no problem in understanding each other.

To Thian Og Bay and Sai Daeng Beach, the two closest (and very beautiful) beaches, it takes about 10 minutes to walk. There will be steep hills on the way. There are bars and restaurants on the beaches with lovely Thai food as well as Western food like burgers, salads and Pizza.

Besides the free shuttle bus service you can also go by local taxis or rent motorbikes.
Since the island has steep hills and narrow roads in many places, you need to be a good driver to rent a motorbike.

Apart from motorbike and taxi, there are other ways of getting around the island. You could rent a long tail boat and take beach stops - snorkelling wherever you like on your way around the island, and why not have your lunch in a small nice restaurant on a beach. There are several!

We strongly recommend you to discover this beautiful island with all its small and charming secluded beaches and viewpoints. Your ultimate guide to this you can easily find on the internet at www.kohtaocompleteguide.com

The closest supermarket is located just outside the village of Chalok called Aukotan Supermarket. You will pass it on your drive to the villa. Here you will find most of the things you need, except meat, fresh bread, fruit and vegetables.

For fresh fruit, vegetables, and herbs, we recommend you continue along the road outside Aukotan, away from Chalok towards Mae Haad village. On the left hand side you will find a small market where you can get these things. Here, they also have all kinds of fish and seafood.

For freshly baked bread and croissants, we recommend the French bakery in Chalok or Mae Haad called Cappuccino Bakery and Bistro. In Mae Haad you also find the Cafe Del Sol offering freshly baked bread.
For meat, you will need to go to a shop called Pods in the village of Mae Haad.

If you need to have some clothes washed please ask our housekeeper Mon, and she will wash it for you at 100 Baht per kilo. Please pay her in cash up front. Please note that you are not allowed to use the laundry room by yourself!,

The villa is absolutely amazing, in top condition and simply wonderful. Mon is great and helped us with everything around the house, including shopping and arranging a private chef for one evening. Ed, the chef, organized a lovely dinner for us, excellent food ans wine and we went to his restaurant many times during our stay.

The villa was sparkle clean and Mon really helps with anything you may need. Also the CSV reception is only a minute away and they also assist with booking massages, taxis etc.

This is a gorgeous property that exceeds expectations and we loved our time there. Sweeping ocean views, beautiful and comfortable architecture and a lovely full-time housekeeper that will help you with everything from groceries whenever you need them to laundry to daily cleaning.

The owner Siri was a pleasure to communicate with as she was super helpful with all trip details. We messaged her a grocery list before arrival and she helped set up a chef to cook at the villa one night which was really special for our group. Other nights, we ordered food from menus at the villa.

There are a couple of sandy beaches within walking distance. The closest one was 10-15 min of walking. We thought that the one that was a bit farther away (20 min?) was great for swimming and totally worth walking to.

Grab doesn't work here, but it was easy to get a taxi/tuk tuk by calling the office that manages the property.

I highly recommend this villa as a special place that's very much worth visiting!

We were a group of 6 people and stayed for 5 nights. Check-in and Check-out worked very smoothly, including the pick (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with Siri was great and easy. The Villa is awesome and the views are stunning. Everything was as described in the listing. Very quiet area and the best hide-away you can imagine. Mon, the housekeeper, was discreet and helpful. The villa was always tidy. The kitchen has absolutely everything you need and more, there are two big refrigerators which offer enough space in case you want to stay in the villa for days without buying groceries every day. There are also nice restaurants delivering food to the villa. The 25 meters infinity saltwater pool is insane!
The reception is available to organize tours and shuttle service to the city are available. There are games, books and snorkeling equipment available in the villa.
This is absolutely the best place we‘ve every stayed at, we would love to come back soon, thank you!

Never recommend enough for this place.
Thanks to Kob who made our stay the best one. Local welcome with cold roasted coconut when we arrived from a very longgg journey, super refreshing! They really think of their guests as they prepared some bread, eggs, butter, and milk in the fridge. So we can cook something easy and get some rest before starting off the next day. Kob is like our Guru for this trip, she recommend good breakfast restaurant (only down the road with fabulous view of Samui sea), small trip to Koh Phangan and she even arranged everything for us. After a half day trip we decided to stay HOME! The house is very well furnished and clean. White tone decoration which gives you a very claim atmosphere and with a private pool right in the front of the living room! Very quite and relaxing. Would definitely come back and bring couple of friends as they have more beautiful houses in town. Thank you for making our trip better than what we expected!!!

Cheers!

Tommys place is amazing. You have to check it out. You are on your own beach on a very quiet island with very few people. The beach is awesome and you can snorkel right in fron tof the place. Food was anazing and Tommy and his staff are incredible hosts. Will definitely go back.

Other things to note
*** PLEASE NOTE, BEACH TIDES APRIL - SEPTEMBER ***
Many beaches along the South and West coast have shallow waters at seasonal times.
From APRIL TO SEPTEMBER, Beach turns into a huge playground with low tide, where the waters will be shallow here with a slightly higher tide in the evenings and more a calm sea. Swimming during the day won't be possible, but the evenings bring more water to have a cool dip. It's a great spot for kids to play in. The beach turns into a huge playground, great for walks, shell and crab picking and safe to stroll & run around freely. There is also an array of Pools around the island to use during low tide and many other beaches close by to visit and explore as well!
I can provide a tide table to check the best moment to swim during the day.

*** PLEASE NOTE PARTIES *** On Friday night, from the villa, we can hear a party called Sabai Bay and located few hundred meters away from the villa. They usually turn off music after midnight. Let's then go dancing!,

This place was beyond perfect. Incredibly beautiful, Mica and his family are exceptional hosts and we hope to be able to come back many times and for much longer stays. We have both traveled the world quite a bit and this place is one of our favorites for sure!

This is a beautiful and relaxing place to be while visiting Koh Pha Ngan. It is an extremely comfortable bungalow to hang out and watch kite boarders in the lagoon. I spent a lot of my visit laying in the hammock on the deck. You are very close to anything you need and it's so nice to be able to get away to this little oasis to recharge while touring. A special mention of the guide book that Mica has put together. We followed his suggestions which introduced us to some cool things we would likely have missed without it.

You won't find a better host anywhere in the world than Mica and Si. They were friendly and polite and gave us a great introduction to the area which gave us the info we needed to go out and enjoy the island. The villa is lovely and gives you a real homely feeling. We only wish we could have stayed for weeks instead of days
Highly recommend

They were amazing hosts. Even ordered a first meal for us upon arrival because we were traveling with a one year old baby. Looking forward to my next visit with Mica and his family next time. Book this if you see it open!

We had an amazing time on Koh Phangan, thanks to Mica, his wife and their beautiful villa!
The place has the perfect location, the beach in front of it is simply stunning. It’s super clean, cleaned by a maid on every day.
Mica is super helpful, he picked us up at the pier, organised a scooter, laundry, taxi and more for us. The communication was easy and fast. Mica’s a very attentive host, we can highly recommend staying at one of his villas!

exceptional host. super helpful with information about activities, nightmarkets,. etc,. Always available when I need anything. the place is beyond perfect. everything you need you'll find it in the house for sure and the sunrise from the hammock is absolutely majestic.

Amazing!! I can only second what everyone else has already told - this villa is just great and Mica and his family are wonderful hosts! The equipment and location of the villa offer everything you need, whether you want to go out or cook for yourself. The porch with the hammock offers the most wonderful view! Mica is super nice and attentive and answers all of your questions very fast. It was such a pleasure staying there and we already regret leaving this little paradise!

Beautiful villas near Lamai Beach! The villas are called Beach Republic Lamai and the property is right on the beach. My villa had its own pool, outdoor kitchen, and outdoor shower. The people I met in Koh Samui were very kind and generous. Staying here is a great value!

In terms of things to do: There is a great coffee and tea shop called Shade about a block down from the villa. There is yoga at Beach Republic a few times a week. I did a half day tour at Samui Elephant Sanctuary Chaweng Noi which is about 10 minutes from the villa and it was excellent. Highly recommend!

An amazing typical villa with a beautiful pool, 3mn to private beach, good restaurant, adorable people ! It was a total hit ⭐️⭐️⭐️🌟🌟
Thank you again !

The villa is perfect, everything you imagined and more. Perfect location it, took us 10 mins ride along to Chaewang and a few minutes around the corner to lamai. The villa is situated on a resort and the staff here are very attentive, the resort has a restaurant, pool and private beach in which you can get massage for 200 baht ! We will definitely stay again. This kind of villa on resort would normally cost a lot more per night, great value for money!

Fantastic Villa in a location that worked well for us, a short walk into the village but far enough away to feel special. The listing was 100% accurate.

Great location, definitely recommend a car rental if you decide to stay here. 12 minutes from chaweng beach and fisherman’s. House looks exactly like the photos, clean and easy to access. A lot of stairs because it’s a 3 story home. Down side is that you have to pay extra for the electricity usage, we stayed for 3 nights and left the ac on because the house would’ve been really hot without it on and ended up paying $60 for electricity. Also be aware that ants will come out if you leave any food or open chip bags out on the counter in the kitchen.

excellent communication very clean great location and view very comfortable. be careful of power use its crazy expensive.
Response from Nick
July 2022
Hi Ed,
Good to hear that you enjoyed your stay and liked the villa. For anyone else reading this, as with most villas on Samui, electricity is charged separately. We charge at cost only and don't make any profit out of this. The average cost from all our previous guests is 350 baht per day which is what Ed paid. It can vary from around 200 to 500 baht per day depending on whether all the ACs in the villa are left on 24/7. Best regards,
Nick

This is the best Air BNB my partner and I have have ever stayed in! The villa is Spacious, totally private, luxurious, with stunning views and your own pool in your own piece of paradise. Jan is the the most helpful, lovely and accommodating host ever!!! She answered all our questions about the area, arranged pick ups from the airport and even hired scooters for us delivered to the villa on our arrival. The villa is walking distance to shops and cafes but scooter needed to explore all the amazing little restaurants in the area. It’s such an incredibly quaint and pretty part of Thailand and the Perch Villa is THE place to stay. We treasured our time at this beautiful haven and can’t wait to come back. If we could give 10 stars we would!

Great spot, recommend hiring some scooters out (there’s a store just on the road next to the location) as it is a little out of town, but a really nice secluded part of lanta. 5stars!

The villa was awesome. To be able to relax and watch the view is really something for your mental health. It was a well deserved rest. Communication with Jan was also easy. She did all the transportation for us and it was a breeze. I cannot recommend the villa enough. Its private and its cosy.

August 2022
The stay at The Perch was extremely delightful. The villa looks even better than the photos. You can sit at the porch forever and look at the ocean. The interiors are done very tastefully as well. It's perfect for spending quality time and a complete mental detox.
The market is at a walking distance and has quite a few good places to buy groceries and have food (particularly thai and indian food). We will be certainly revisiting!

This is a great little resort. The owners are very nice and offer quite a few extra amenities that you can pay for that enhance the experience. The view is fantastic from the pool or dining area. It is difficult to get there though unless you use their taxi service as the roads are very steep and other taxis won't go all the way.

A mini pool villa for a couple who look for a nice and quiet vacation. Located in the Heart of Bang MaKham, local of Koh Samui. The sunset of Bang MaKham will be your best experience of your vacation.
The space
The Humble Villas is a new boutique hotel. We call our self as a Villa Hotel. We design each room on the concept of Private Pool Villa. We have daily rate and monthly rate and we provide a part of hotel service such as Breakfast, Bar and Limited Hour Reception.
The whole property were build and design base on the owner wooden obsession. Most of the furnitures in the room and around the property were use by the ancient old wood from our great grandfather age (50-70 yrs ago). It was perfectly well fit when we combine the Wooden and the Pool Villa of Bang MaKham Beach. This is the place for those couple who searching for the quite beach and the localise of Koh Samui.
Other things to note
We are open on AirBnb. It is room number 12 only with plunge pool in front. This room is behind a restaurant, that why will see a roof of restaurant and liitle view of the sea. And booking with AirBnb not including breakfast.

As a villa so we don't staff 24 hrs our reception working time is 06:00-21:00. So after 21:00 there will be only one security who still guarding from 18:00-06:00 next day.,

The humble villa is a fantastic place with a small private pool in front of your room.
A big shared infinity pool with a fantastic view over the ocean.
The room is big, clean, very modern and contains a mini bar.
the staff is very friendly good English speaking, and very flexible regarding check in and check out times.
I will most definitely recommend this place for staying if your going to Koh Samui.
(there is a small trip to the shops) but it has the best view on the island.

How can I say (Website hidden by Airbnb) is not enough. If you wanna feel like at home but in the middle of the paradise it is the right place. Amanda makes us feel part of her familiy. It's been amazing be there with all her kind family. It is a perfect mix with relax, sea, food, experiences and Sri Lankan vibes. We never wanted to leave. I suggest this place to everyone.

Warning: if you visit Mandi's Moon Isle Beach Bungalow, you do know when you arrive, but you're not sure when you'll leave... We planned to stay 4 nights but ended up cancelling the rest of our trip and stayed over a week at this little place of paradise.

Mandi is very charming and her staff is great. We immediately felt at home, enjoyed the wonderful scenery and the no - nonsense approach of Mandi & C°. You need an activitiy, a driver, any help,...? Mandi can help you out. There is no better place to stay in Nilavelli. Go over there and you will not be disappointed!

We travelled as a family with five kids. Mandys place is really great. Very clean, with aircondition, she takes really care of everything. My kids were very picky about the food, this was also no problem, she made a big pot of spaghetti for all of us. She also organized a boat tour to see dolphins. The Beach is very beautiful and directly in front of your nouse. Its a little beautiful paradise.

Vin is an amazing host. He gave us a warm welcome and a tour of the property. The property is amazing and right next to the beach. The view is amazing and whoever loves the sound of waves should definitely stay here. It’s very peaceful and the food is amazing as well.
Would definitely recommend it to everyone

The dome's were stunning! They were beautifully decorated and had all the amenity one might need for a glamping experience.
The beach is just outside and it is amazing to fall asleep listening to the waves crash onto the shore.
The bed is quite comfortable and the setup with the bathtub and lounge chairs outside is very picturesque.
My only complaint is that the toilet is away from the dome which makes it uncomfortable especially in the rain and in the night.

The BnB is a beachfront property and is really pretty. It has a few photo locations that are nice.
The pool and adjacent bar is great.

Vin is an incredible host and the staff is very helpful as well.
If you choose the half board option you get a surprise dinner which is very tasty and filling.

Overall it was a great stay and I would love to visit it again.

Truc’s private feedback for you:
“Vin is an amazing host. Very good customer service. On the day of arrival he greeted us like we are a guest coming to his home which made us feel very welcomed. Thank you for that. Surprise dinners and breakfasts was excellent. Flower bath on the beach is very photogenic as all decoration inside dome are amazing. Vin also recommended us a Phi Phi Island tour with a company Last minute and that saved us more than 1000baht/person. Highly recommend the Glamping experience and The island tours.”

When we were planning our visit to Phuket, we came across this listing and were so intrigued- we HAD to book it and see it for ourselves. It turned out to be one of the coolest places we've ever stayed! The beach bubbles are so adorable, and the bed was surprisingly comfortable for being in a tent. Having our own bathroom was really nice, and the amenities were really wonderful- food, drink, helpful staff that can call taxis for you etc. Vin went above and beyond - his communication and helpfulness far surpassed any expectations I had- he even arranged a private car for us coming from the airport. Book this experience- it's so unique and wonderful!

There is an extremely busy road onto this place and I didn’t like it, it was difficult to have food outside of camp site. For this reason I wouldn’t stay again. The camp site is beautiful and a lot of work has gone into it. There is a lovely vibe. I couldn’t fault the actual site. There are big secure gates into it, however as it’s backing onto the beach any one can access from beach side, vin has cameras everywhere and I’d say it’s very safe but with kids I felt a little cautious. But stay here, you wont regret it

Great place! We stayed for three days. We made use of the hosts driver and he was great but not the extra cleaning service not included in the price. You may want to take that extra service to keep the home working properly. The owners own a restaurant so we ordered our first meal there and it was very delicious and delivered to the table.

This was my first time booking a place to stay on Airbnb and I met a great host like Marine. I think it was lucky for me and our whole family. This stay was really great. The booking on Airbnb was too high. I'm afraid it will be difficult to meet such a good host in the future.
Marine is a beautiful and hard-working person from the south of France, making every corner of the villa sparkling clean and touched our whole family.We stayed four nights and she left almost every day from cleaning up after breakfast until noon.This is the first time I have seen such a beautiful, elegant and very powerful French woman.
Her villa is a 5-minute drive from Fisherman's Village, not far from supermarkets and markets, and you can also rent motorbikes at the villa entrance property, making it very convenient if you go out to buy ingredients.
The soft furnishings and bedding in her villa are very tasteful, with a logo on it. I only asked when I asked that she designed it herself, and it was a combination of her and her husband's name. During our stay, we felt love every corner.If you come to Koh Samui for a holiday with your family or loved ones, don't hesitate to choose Marine's villa and you will not be disappointed.
It's worth mentioning that Marine's breakfast is delicious, and you can tell that she's a good fit for the Oriental appetite.She and her husband have a beachside restaurant called Yinyang in Fisherman's Village, very affordable and tasty, highly recommended.

Wonderful and luxurious beach resort in a serene secluded setting... a hidden treasure in Laguna Lang Co. The food was excellent and the staff was very accommodating. Highly recommended!

This apartment and resort were too good to be true. The apartment was devine and was the best place we have ever stayed. With teenage children it was simply perfect as they could hang in rooms, go to pool, go to gym. So much to do without even leaving. The staff and service was perfect and I cannot say thank you enough to Sanctuary for hosting us at your incredible resort. We hope to be back. Highly recommended!

Very beautiful sea and beaches
Quiet resort
The place was exactly as what u see in the photos,
The staff was very nice and friendly
The pool was okay, but not an infinite one
Enjoyed the rooftop BBQ and room service
Also lunch at the moonba
Very good food, expensive for bietnam standard, but it is a 5star resort so okay for me
The communication was very smooth.
Cannot ask for a better place
Very worthy of the money spent
Would recommend to friends
However, if u want some nightlife or very local food, this place is not for you, it is too remote to even go out

Wow. This place is great but a long ways away from the sights unless you have set your sights on the sea. Since it is a resort and there are no stores around they have you on the hook for everything, but whatever.

Een perfecte plek. Dichtbij het leuke Bo Put en diverse stranden. Gastvrij ontvangst en een mooie villa. Enige kritiek die ik kan bedenken is wat klein onderhoud dat de villa wel verdiend. Verder brandschoon en goed voorzien van alle gemakken.

这个房子是小区视野最好的一桩，五六个人最合适不过。起床两个房间风景极好。房东管家贴心到位，一些建议很合适。可以多咨询。最让我们惊喜的是房子附近的fishermans village，吃，玩，出海，逛都不比查文海滩差，因为人少还很干净。非常棒的一次bnb。推荐。
